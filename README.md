## Introduction
There is a Aperture Science Terminal built with Flash in [aperturescience.com](https://aperturescience.com) in 2007. But Flash was gone a long time ago.

Now I reimplement it in C++.

## Status
Almost complete — only three minor easter eggs remain, which are not planned for implementation.
## Build
Just `g++`. Requires at least C++11. A newer C++ standard is recommended.

en_US: `g++ -std=c++17 -O2 ReApertureTerminal.cpp -o ReApertureTerminal`\
zh_CN: `g++ ReApertureTerminal.cpp -o ReApertureTerminal -std=c++17 -O2 -DLANG_ZH_CN`
